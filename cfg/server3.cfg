//OPEN FORTRESS SETTINGS
//These settings are unique to Open Fortress and will not work in normal Team Fortress 2.

//Air Dash count: Set to -1 by default to allow Scout to double-jump. When set to 1, all classes besides Scout can double-jump, including the Mercenary. Recommendation for a vanilla experience is to keep this setting as-is.

//Special Classes: As Open Fortress progresses through development we will incrementally add more classes beyond the standard nine characters from Team Fortress 2. Mercenary and Civilian are not counted as "Special" by this setting at the time of writing but will be in the future. Currently, enabling this allows players to become the currently unused "Juggernaut" class (depicted as a buff Civilian armed only with Fists and a large health pool) via the join_class juggernaut command. Recommended to keep disabled unless hosting a sandbox server.
of_allow_special_classes 0

//Arena: When enabled, allows you only one life per round. Recommended to keep disabled unless hosting a "Last Man Standing" or "Clan Arena" type server.
of_arena 0

//Bunnyhop: Set to -1 by default, which only allows the non-Zombie Mercenary class to hold space to repeatedly jump. When set to 0, no class can do this, instead requiring you to time your space presses to gain speed when jumping. When set to 1, all classes from Team Fortress 2 can hold space to repeatedly jump. When set to 2, everyone including Zombies can autohop.
